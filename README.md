# Charge Hub : Optimal Deployment of Electric Vehicles & Charging Stations

Charge Hub serves as an optimization tool designed to identify the most suitable locations for Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Stations, facilitating easy access for owners and fostering a connection with the eco-friendly community.

The application considers various points of interest, such as petrol pumps, CNG stations, parking lots, shopping complexes, and more. Specifically, petrol pumps and CNG stations are treated as one subset, while the remaining points of interest form another subset.

Within a defined radius (denoted as R), at least one EV charger is mandated at petrol and CNG pumps, with the value of R determined through a statistical analysis model. The decision on which petrol pumps to equip with EV chargers is guided by statistical analysis and optimization, involving diverse parameters.

Similarly, for other locations like parking lots, shopping complexes, etc., the same methodology is employed to prioritize the installation of EV chargers based on statistical analysis and optimization, ensuring an efficient and strategic placement.
